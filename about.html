            <h2>About Our Blue Bird Store-Macaw Birds For For Sale</h2>     
            <p>Our Blue Birds Store is a breeding home that specializes in hand fed Hyacinth Macaw, Lear's Macaw, Spix Macaw, and Palm Cockatoo parrots. We are celebrating our sixth anniversary!
                With an emphasis on safety, we sell over 35 different toys and cages.
                In terms of pellets, we carry Zupreem, Pretty Bird, Kaytee, Harrison Bird Diet, and Roudybush, with a focus on Goldenfeast, Kaytee, and Higgins for seeds.
                We are a licensed retailer of premium cage brands like Tri Birds, Strong Bird Cages, Featherland Bird Cages, Kings Cages, and HQ Cages. Bird cages made of stainless steel are our specialty.
                Additionally, we provide the best natural wood perches for cages, rolls, and tables made of sandblasted dragon, natural and sandblasted manzanita, coffee wood, and sandblasted grapevine wood. Natural wood is essential since it gives birds' feet the proper exercise thanks to its variable diameter. Because wooden dowels limit the range of motion in the feet, they promote arthritis and muscular atrophy. We have been in business since 2013 and have never let our customers down.
                The majority of our consumers came to us through recommendations from other customers. At our Macaw Farm, employees must own birds in order to work there, so you can be confident that anybody you speak with has firsthand experience with owning birds. We all have to take care of our birds - they have no one but us.
                In a perfect world, rainforests would remain intact and there would be no need to initiate breeding programs or purchase properties in the native lands where wild parrots currently live, for the many now endangered species.
                We don't live in a perfect world, though, and it's almost certain that many of the parrots living in their natural habitats would go extinct within 20 years, were it not for (1) home breeding programs (regardless of what a Greenpeace founder says. ), and (2) the outright purchase of these parrots' actual habitat so that they remain in the wild (such as the Nature Conservancy). Without credible and honest dealers and breeders, most home-bred birds lead miserable lives and die from neglect. Before you decide to bring a parrot home, make sure you understand the responsibilities of bird ownership. They can live to be 60 (make sure you change your will properly) and it's best if they stay in the same household. Hyacinth Macaw For Sale
                We turn away many people who love the beauty of exotic birds and/or want a talking parrot but don't understand the intelligence and proper interaction required on a daily basis to keep these amazing creatures happy.
                Truth has built our business.
                Of course, we "sell" birds.
                But we like to think of it as "placing" the birds in good homes. Our mission is to give money to breeders who play an important role in the survival of the species by educating people and placing these home-raised birds in wonderful, loving homes.    
                How come?
                So kids will always be able to see live, real parrots for themselves, and we won't tell them stories that start with "I remember they flew in the rainforests ..." We all have to take care of our birds - they have no one but us. Spix Macaw For Sale
