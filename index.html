                        <p>we got our first Pair of Hyacinth Macaw Bird Kuz, the breeder was very friendly and made the experience less stressful. We can tell that they were very well socialized and this helped with his transition to our home. The best and most adorable gift ever.</p>

Here is one of his pictures. The day before he was scheduled to sit for his holiday pictures, he was all over me trying to retrieve a candy bar from underneath the cabinet. When we picked him up from the airport, we were so glad because they did great work in coordinating his travel, we couldn’t believe he came safely. with our permission, you may add our contact number on your website as a reference.</p>

    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>Our Blue Birds Store is located in USA. We breed Haycinth Macaws, Spix macaws, Lears Macaws, and Palm Cockatoo birds.Our chicks are hand-reared, which means we spend a lot of time with them during their whole feeding and socialization process, from hatching through weaning and beyond. We make sure that each bird receives enough socialization so that they can succeed as feathered friends.</p>
